\textbf{Summary:} The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have more associations with human diseases than any other genes, and there are thousands of different HLA alleles in the human population.
Data for all known HLA genotypes are curated in the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database, and allele frequencies for each HLA allele across human populations are available in the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND).
Our open-source R package \textit{hlabud} accesses HLA data from IMGT and AFND, and supports further analysis such as HLA divergence calculation, fine-mapping analysis of amino acid (or nucleotide) positions, and low-dimensional embedding.
