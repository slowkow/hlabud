\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}

Our open-source R package \textit{hlabud} gives users access to HLA data from two public databases, and implements HLA divergence calculation Pierini2018.
\textit{hlabud} downloads and caches HLA genotype data from the IMGT-HLA GitHub repository imgthla and prepares the data for downstream analysis in R.

We provide \href{https://slowkow.github.io/hlabud}{tutorials} for HLA divergence, fine-mapping association analysis with logistic regression, embedding with UMAP, and visualizing allele frequencies from the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) Gonzalez-Galarza2020.

\subsection{Related Work}

BIGDAWG is an R package that provides functions for chi-squared Hardy-Weinberg and case-control association tests of highly polymorphic genetic data like HLA genotypes Pappas2016. HATK is set of Python scripts for processing and analyzing IMGT-HLA data Choi2020.
