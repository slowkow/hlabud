  abstract = "The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/,
              currently contains over 25 000 allele sequence for 45 genes,
              which are located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex
              (MHC) of the human genome. This region is the most polymorphic
              region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen
              exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand
              variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just
              simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a
              stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this
              information, providing the scientific and medical community
              access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that
              are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The
              number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the
              number of new variants being identified has necessitated a
              dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and
              publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to
              provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while
              supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of
              sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing
              and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need
              to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.",
