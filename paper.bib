  abstract = "The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/,
              currently contains over 25 000 allele sequence for 45 genes,
              which are located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex
              (MHC) of the human genome. This region is the most polymorphic
              region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen
              exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand
              variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just
              simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a
              stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this
              information, providing the scientific and medical community
              access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that
              are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The
              number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the
              number of new variants being identified has necessitated a
              dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and
              publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to
              provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while
              supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of
              sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing
              and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need
              to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.",

  abstract = "Bridging ImmunoGenomic Data-Analysis Workflow Gaps (BIGDAWG) is
              an integrated data-analysis pipeline designed for the
              standardized analysis of highly-polymorphic genetic data,
              specifically for the HLA and KIR genetic systems. Most modern
              genetic analysis programs are designed for the analysis of single
              nucleotide polymorphisms, but the highly polymorphic nature of
              HLA and KIR data require specialized methods of data analysis.
              BIGDAWG performs case-control data analyses of highly polymorphic
              genotype data characteristic of the HLA and KIR loci. BIGDAWG
              performs tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculates allele
              frequencies and bins low-frequency alleles for k$\times$2 and
              2$\times$2 chi-squared tests, and calculates odds ratios,
              confidence intervals and p-values for each allele. When
              multi-locus genotype data are available, BIGDAWG estimates
              user-specified haplotypes and performs the same binning and
              statistical calculations for each haplotype. For the HLA loci,
              BIGDAWG performs the same analyses at the individual amino-acid
              level. Finally, BIGDAWG generates figures and tables for each of
              these comparisons. BIGDAWG obviates the error-prone reformatting
              needed to traffic data between multiple programs, and streamlines
              and standardizes the data-analysis process for case-control
              studies of highly polymorphic data. BIGDAWG has been implemented
              as the bigdawg R package and as a free web application at
              bigdawg.immunogenomics.org.",

  abstract = "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is associated with more
              human complex diseases than any other locus. In many diseases it
              explains more heritability than all other known loci combined.
              Investigators have now demonstrated the accuracy of in silico HLA
              imputation methods. These approaches enable rapid and accurate
              estimation of HLA alleles in the millions of individuals that are
              already genotyped on microarrays. HLA imputation has been used to
              define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I
              diabetes, and infectious diseases, such as HIV infection control.
              However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation,
              association testing, and fine-mapping. Here, we present
              comprehensive statistical genetics guide to impute HLA alleles
              from genotype data. We provide detailed protocols, including
              standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and
              describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids including
              a web-based Michigan Imputation Server. We updated the HLA
              imputation reference panel representing global populations
              (African, East Asian, European and Latino) available at the
              Michigan Imputation Server ( n = 20,349) and achived high
              imputation accuracy (mean dosage correlation r = 0.981). We
              finally offer best practice recommendations to conduct
              association tests in order to define the alleles, amino acids,
              and haplotypes affecting human traits. This protocol will be
              broadly applicable to the large-scale genotyping data and
              contribute to defining the role of HLA in human diseases across
              global populations. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement B.H. is a

@ARTICLE{Kennedy2017,
  title    = "{What has GWAS done for HLA and disease associations?}",
  author   = "Kennedy, A E and Ozbek, U and Dorak, M T",
  abstract = "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is located in
              chromosome 6p21 and contains crucial regulators of immune
              response, including human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes,
              alongside other genes with nonimmunological roles. More recently,
              a repertoire of noncoding RNA genes, including expressed
              pseudogenes, has also been identified. The MHC is the most gene
              dense and most polymorphic part of the human genome. The region
              exhibits haplotype-specific linkage disequilibrium patterns,
              contains the strongest cis- and trans-eQTLs/meQTLs in the genome
              and is known as a hot spot for disease associations. Another
              layer of complexity is provided to the region by the extreme
              structural variation and copy number variations. While the HLA-B
              gene has the highest number of alleles, the HLA-DR/DQ subregion
              is structurally most variable and shows the highest number of
              disease associations. Reliance on a single reference sequence has
              complicated the design, execution and analysis of GWAS for the
              MHC region and not infrequently, the MHC region has even been
              excluded from the analysis of GWAS data. Here, we contrast
              features of the MHC region with the rest of the genome and
              highlight its complexities, including its functional
              polymorphisms beyond those determined by single nucleotide
              polymorphisms or single amino acid residues. One of the several
              issues with customary GWAS analysis is that it does not address
              this additional layer of polymorphisms unique to the MHC region.
              We highlight alternative approaches that may assist with the
              analysis of GWAS data from the MHC region and unravel
              associations with all functional polymorphisms beyond single
              SNPs. We suggest that despite already showing the highest number
              of disease associations, the true extent of the involvement of
              the MHC region in disease genetics may not have been uncovered.",
