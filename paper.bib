  abstract = "The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/,
              currently contains over 25 000 allele sequence for 45 genes,
              which are located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex
              (MHC) of the human genome. This region is the most polymorphic
              region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen
              exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand
              variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just
              simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a
              stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this
              information, providing the scientific and medical community
              access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that
              are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The
              number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the
              number of new variants being identified has necessitated a
              dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and
              publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to
              provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while
              supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of
              sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing
              and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need
              to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.",

  abstract = "Bridging ImmunoGenomic Data-Analysis Workflow Gaps (BIGDAWG) is
              an integrated data-analysis pipeline designed for the
              standardized analysis of highly-polymorphic genetic data,
              specifically for the HLA and KIR genetic systems. Most modern
              genetic analysis programs are designed for the analysis of single
              nucleotide polymorphisms, but the highly polymorphic nature of
              HLA and KIR data require specialized methods of data analysis.
              BIGDAWG performs case-control data analyses of highly polymorphic
              genotype data characteristic of the HLA and KIR loci. BIGDAWG
              performs tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculates allele
              frequencies and bins low-frequency alleles for k$\times$2 and
              2$\times$2 chi-squared tests, and calculates odds ratios,
              confidence intervals and p-values for each allele. When
              multi-locus genotype data are available, BIGDAWG estimates
              user-specified haplotypes and performs the same binning and
              statistical calculations for each haplotype. For the HLA loci,
              BIGDAWG performs the same analyses at the individual amino-acid
              level. Finally, BIGDAWG generates figures and tables for each of
              these comparisons. BIGDAWG obviates the error-prone reformatting
              needed to traffic data between multiple programs, and streamlines
              and standardizes the data-analysis process for case-control
              studies of highly polymorphic data. BIGDAWG has been implemented
              as the bigdawg R package and as a free web application at
              bigdawg.immunogenomics.org.",
