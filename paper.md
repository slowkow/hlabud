# Summary

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode the proteins that display antigens for the immune system to recognize pathogens like bacteria and viruses.
Genes in the HLA locus on chromosome 6 in the human genome have thousands of different alleles in the human population.
The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding different amino acids in HLA genes are the genetic variants with the largest effect sizes, and they are associated with risk of developing autoimmune disease [@Kennedy2017].
The fields of immunology and genomics aim to discover molecular factors, such as HLA genotypes, that explain the functions of the human immune system in health and disease.
Analysis of this genotype data requires computational methods for managing collections of genetic data and transforming data into different encodings for downstream analyses [@Sakaue2022].

# Statement of need

`hlabud` is an R package for conveniently downloading and analyzing the data from the IMGT/HLA database of HLA genotypes [@Robinson2020].
The R programming language has a large repository of open-source libraries for statistical modeling and data visualization that can be applied to any data analysis.
The API for `hlabud` is designed to provide functions that output simple lists of matrices and data frames to facilitate seamless integration with any other packages.
The documentation includes usage examples for analysis of a one-hot encoding of amino acid positions such as logistic regression association analysis with amino acid positions and low dimensional embedding with UMAP.
HLA genotype data is lazily downloaded (as-needed) from the IMGT-HLA GitHub repository [@imgthla] and cached in a user-configurable directory.

The BIGDAWG R package provides functions for chi-squared Hardy-Weinberg and case-control association tests of highly polymorphic genetic data like HLA genotypes [@Pappas2016].
In contrast, `hlabud` was designed to be a minimal package that provides flexible functions to facilitate any downstream HLA analyses.
`hlabud` can be used by biomedical researchers and also by students in courses that teach immunology, genetics, and bioinformatics.
